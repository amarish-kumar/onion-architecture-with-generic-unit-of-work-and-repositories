Onion architecture with Generic Unit of Work and Repositories

This project is a combination of

- https://genericunitofworkandrepositories.codeplex.com/ 
and
- http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/

The main goal of the project is to offert a really complete template of Onion architecture, ready to go, with the most updated version of generic unit of work and repositories.

Feel free to update this template to include the latest standard about the architecture.
